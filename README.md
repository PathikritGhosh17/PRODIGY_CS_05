Network Packet Analyzer
This is a lightweight Network Packet Analyzer built using Python and the powerful Scapy library. It captures and analyzes live network packets, extracting essential details like source/destination IPs, ports, protocol types, TTL, and even the payload (if available).

Features
1. Real-time packet sniffing using Scapy
2. Identifies and analyzes:
 a. IP layer
 b. TCP & UDP protocols
 c. Packet size and TTL
 d. Payload contents (decoded if possible)
3. Counts and logs each packet inspected
4. Clean and structured terminal output
